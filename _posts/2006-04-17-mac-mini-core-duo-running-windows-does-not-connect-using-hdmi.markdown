I am really frustrated that my Mac Mini Core Duo running Windows wont display an image on my HDTV using a DVI to HDMI connector. It works perfectly in OS X but someone forgot to add that functionality into the windows driver. Thanks ATI! I would love to see an update to the driver that fixes this. What an annoyance. Almost as annoying as the problems I am having with the Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse.
