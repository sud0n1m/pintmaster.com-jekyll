Today, I decided to add a new section to this blog. Primarily related to my ridiculous misadventures in the kitchen. I tend to make things off the top of my head and just throw anything in there that I feel like. Today's ridiculous invention is:

Difficulty: Easy to Medium
Time: 20 minutes prep + 60 minutes baking
<a href="http://pintmaster.com/gallery2/v/Cooking/Meatpile_cooked.html"><img src="http://pintmaster.com/gallery2/d/1156-2/Meatpile_cooked" align=right alt="Meatpile Cooked" /></a>Meatpile is a dish that I invented because I didnt have the right pan to make a loaf. I also didnt have any bread to make breadcrumbs, or onions. This is one of my usual heavily substituted dishes!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 package Jennie-o Ground Turkey (extra lean)</li>
	<li>1 package Jennie-o Breakfast sausage</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>Small can of tomato paste</li>
	<li>Heinz Tomato Ketchup</li>
	<li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
	<li>Garlic Powder</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>Some flour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Set your oven to 350 degrees C</li>
	<li>Grease the bottom of a large baking dish (clearly to large for your meat)</li>
	<li>In a large mixing bowl, add the ground turkey, turkey sausage (squeeze them out of the casings first), tomato paste, garlic powder, pepper, some flour (just a little), 2 eggs (or one for less mushy result)</li>
	<li>Using your hands, mix everything together until it is mixed thoroughly</li>
	<li>Put the pile of meat in the baking dish in whatever shape you like. Average thickness should be 3 - 4 inches</li>
	<li><a href="http://pintmaster.com/gallery2/v/Cooking/Meatpile_Raw.html"><img src="http://pintmaster.com/gallery2/d/1160-2/Meatpile_Raw" align="right"/></a>Coat the top of the meatpile in Ketchup and smooth it around the edges (see picture></li>
	<li>Bake for 60 minutes</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
It actually is not that good. It was kinda mushy. In regular meatloaf, you are supposed to use breadcrumbs. Let me know what you think!
