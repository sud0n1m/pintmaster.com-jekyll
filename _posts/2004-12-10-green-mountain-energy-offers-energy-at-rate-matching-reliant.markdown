It is good to see rising energy prices as long as they arent yours. Veronique and I made the decision to go with renewable wind energy in the "Energy Capital of the World". We were paying a little more per KwH, but according to this article, it seems that Reliant and other dirty energies are catching up to us! Conscionable capitalism does pay off sometimes!
