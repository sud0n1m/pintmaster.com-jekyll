Well, according to one of its employees, it isnt. Since we have an obligation to be fair and balanced (we dont), I thought I would post the comment received from an irate silverleaf employee on <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/20051129/awards-verification-center/">another post on this site</a> about the numerous "idiots" whom they solicit for timeshares. Please note, this comment has been transcribed verbatim. I apologize for the author yelling in caps:

<blockquote>JUST TO LET YOU KIDS KNOW WE ARE REGISTERED WITH THE â€œBBBâ€?â€¦.NO IT DOES NOT SAY ON THE LETTER OR POSTCARD YOU RECEIVE IN THE MAIL THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS YOU HAVE TO MEET THATS WHY BEFORE YOU DRIVE OUT THERE THESE PEOPLE CALLED â€œVACATION COORDINATORSâ€? AS YOU PEOPLE CALL THEM (THE EMPLOYEES AT SILVERLEAF CALL THEM VERIFIERS) GET ON THE PHONE AND QUALIFY YOU BROKE ASS PEOPLE BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR TIME DRIVING SOMEWHERE YOU WOULDNT EVEN BELONG IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE ONLY GOD FORSAKEN REASON WHY PEOPLE CALL THIS A â€œSCAMâ€? IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LIARS THEMSELVES. THE ONE AND THE ONLY REASON ANYONE WOULD BE TURNED DOWN AT THE RESORT IS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE PROMOTION. DO YOU IDIOTS EVEN KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE SAY â€œNOW PLEASE BE AWARE YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PRESENT 2 FORMS OF I.D. , ONE BEING A DRIVERS LICENSE AND 2 BEING A MAJOR CREDIT CARD, MARRIED COUPLES MUST TOUR TOGETHER (EVEN IF YOU ARE LEGALLY SEPERATED THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE LEGALLY DIVORCED AND STILL MARRIED COUPLES TOUR TOGETHER GENIOUS) AND DEPENDING ON WHAT STATE YOU LIVE IN AND WHETHER YOU ARE SINGLE OR MARRIED THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS RANGE FROM TX- MARRIED 40K â€¦SINGLE 45K
GEORGIA-MARRIED-45K SINGLE 50Kâ€¦IL & NY/MA-MARRIED-50K SINGLE 55Kâ€¦.YOU GO THROUGHT 3-4 PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT SAME SHIT BEFORE YOU EVEN GO OUT TO THE RESORT SO MAYBE SOME OF YOU SHOULD OPEN YOUR EARS DOUCHE BAGSâ€¦SO ANYONE THAT WRITES A COMMENT BASHING THE â€œAWARDS VERIFICATION CENTERâ€? WHICH YOU PEOPLE REALLY DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE THE 2ND CALL CENTER IS REALLY LOCATED CAN GO SCREW YOURSELFâ€¦I HAVE WORKED HERE FOR OVER A YEAR NOW THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR ALMOST 30 AT THAT. NOW ANSWER ME THISâ€¦IF WE ARE REGISTERED WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS THIS LONG AND ARE ALSO STILL OWNING OPERATING AND ALSO OPENING RESORTS ALL AROUND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DO YOU REALLY THINK WE ARE LOSING OUT ON THE 100 PEOPLE ON THIS PAGE WHO SAY â€œOH I DONT GIVE A SHITâ€? BUT YET GAVE SHIT ENOUGH TO WRITE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW ANGRY THEY WERE? UHH NO! YOU PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT FOR EVEN THINKING YOU COULD PUT SUSAN MURRAY BEHIND BARSâ€¦DO YOU PEOPLE EVEN KNOW WHO SHE IS? NO. WHEN YOU CALL THE AWARDS VERIFICATION CENTER AND ASK FOR SANDRA OR KIM OR TRAVIS THOMAS DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE? NO. BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL MORONS FOR NOT SPENDING AN HOUR OF YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE GETTING AT THE LEAST A VACATION FOR 2 PEOPLE PAID FOR. WHAT KIND OF MORON DOES THAT? YOU PEOPLE ARE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY OH NOTHING IS FREE IN LIFE. WELL NO SH*T NEITHER IS YOUR TIME THATS WHY TO THANK YOU FOR COMING AND SPENDING 90 MINUTES OF YOUR USELESS NON-PRODUCTIVE POOR LIVES OUT HERE WE GIVE YOU 2 PRIZES FOR NOTHINGâ€¦YOU PEOPLE ARE IDIOTIC USELESS AND DUH EVERY D*MN BUSINESS IN THE WHOLE F***ING COUNTRY HAS BAD THINGS WRITTEN ABOUT THEM SOMEWHERE BUT HOW LONG DO SCAMS REALLY LAST? 30 YEARSâ€¦UHHH COMMON SENSE PEOPLE NOâ€¦ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERY COUPLE MONTHS OUR LAWYERS AND JUDGES GO OVER THE SCRIPTS WE READ AND SAY â€œOH YES THATS PERFECTLY LEGALâ€? ARE YOU SERIOUSLY THINKING YOU PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE A MIND OF YOU OWN BELIEVING THESE CLOSED MINDEDâ€?OH I DONT HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT MY GAY MARRAIGEâ€? PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY SAY TO KEEP YOU FROM SEEING A GORGEOUS RESORT AND RECEIVING 2 PRIZES FOR NOTHING????? I WENT OUT TO THE PINEY SHORES RESORT WHICH IS LOCATED OFF 45 ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR NORTH OF HOUSTONâ€¦GOT BOTH MY PRIZES AND LEFT HAPPYâ€¦I HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED MY VACATION PACKAGE AND WENT ON THE TRIP TO VEGASâ€¦OH WAIT YOU KNOW WHY I ACTUALLY RECEIVED MINE? FIRST OF ALL I SET THE APPOINTMENT AND ACTUALLY SHOWED AND DIDNT LIE LIKE A FILTHY RAT SECONDLY I DIDNT F***ING LIE TO 3-4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAYING OH YES I MEET ALL OF THOSE QUALIFICATIONS AND THEN GO TO THE RESORT LIKE A MORON AND CHANGE MY MIND ALL OF A SUDDEN AND SAY â€œOH WELL I GUESS I DONT MAKE 40K A YEAR LIKE I SAID 4 DAYS AGOâ€? MORONS YOU PEOPLE ARE WORTH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND YOU MEAN NOTHING TO THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. GOD HATES YOU AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO PLAY IN TRAFFIC
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME
