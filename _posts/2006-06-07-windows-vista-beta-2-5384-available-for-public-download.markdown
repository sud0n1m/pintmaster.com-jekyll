<a href="http://download.windowsvista.com/preview/beta2/en/x86/download.htm">Get your copy here! Hot of the press!</a> Microsoft has released a public beta of Windows Vista Beta 2. They are using a download manager (somewhat like bittorrent) from Akamai that frankly sucks. It keeps stalling and saying it has lost the connection. I wish there was a torrent up there of this file since that is a much better way to download than DD or Akamai's crappy download manager. What a joke.
