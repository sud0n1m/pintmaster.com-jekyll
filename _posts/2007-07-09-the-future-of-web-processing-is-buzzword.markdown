<p><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/buzzword.thumbnail.png" alt="Buzzword" align="left" />My friend Pach wrote his final papers (something like 2000 pages in all) for his masters degree in Philosophy in <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>. It has everything academics need for papers. It even has some features like versioning and backup that are difficult or non-existent on off-line word processors (Microsoft Word). The big drawback with <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> and similar software is layout - quite simply making it look the way you want it to. I tried out some software that may solve that problem. <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/09/the-future-of-web-processing-is-buzzword/#more-104">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
