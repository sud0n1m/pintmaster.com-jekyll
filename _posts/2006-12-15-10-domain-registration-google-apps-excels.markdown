I use <a href="http://google.com/a">google apps</a> for all my domains. Google's email and calendaring are superior systems to any other free hosted systems out there for having domain email, calendaring, chat. Now, google has made it even easier by offering $10 domain registration. This makes it simple to register a domain and get up and running with Google's email. Ideally, you'll want to use a host for your website - their current solution is a little weak, but for the most part, its a great price and minimal effort. Nice one google!
