Worried about getting busted using Bittorrent? You probably should be since it doesnt hide your identity. It seems that downloading movies is more likely to get you busted than other content. I have several friends who got notices from their internet provider after downloading movies. You may be able to do that safely too!

The way it works is by blocking IP addresses. Your list is updated based on a master list, and you can choose if you want to block corporations, educational institutions, governments, etc.

In non-technical terms, internet addresses, just like physical addresses can be traced to their owners. By blocking addresses that are more likely to be tracking copyright infringement or sending bad data, it enables you to sneak under the radar and continue to download.

As always, be careful where you get your torrents from and use a reputable source like piratebay or tvrss. While I am on the subject, I'll give a plug for <a href="http://utorrent.com">¬µTorrent</a> too! It's a great windows based bittorrent client. If you are on a mac, <a href="http://www.bitrocket.org/">Bitrocket</a> is increasing in quality at a really fast pace. The built in search is awesome.

Worried about getting busted for music? <a href="http://allofmp3.com">allofmp3</a> is still up and running, and according to them is legal! I dont know about that, but $2 an album is the price music <em>should </em>be!
