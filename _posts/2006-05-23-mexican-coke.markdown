I recently learned you can get Mexican coke at Fiesta! Coke, made with Real Sugar, not high fructose corn syrup crap! Im going to go to Fiesta and pick me up some Mexican coke. I'll report back with pictures and my analysis of the taste. In case you're wondering, I grew up with sugar coke in Singapore and not the high-fatness corn syrup that infests every single junk food product in the US.
