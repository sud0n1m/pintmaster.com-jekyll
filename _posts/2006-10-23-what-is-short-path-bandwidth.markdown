I signed up for web hosting with Media Temple. Seems like a great service since I can host all of my sites on one hosting plan. But I wonder, wtf is Short Path bandwidth? A few more hints on their site:
<blockquote>Expand the audience for your creative content by serving more visitors faster than ever before with a <strong>Terabyte</strong> of multi-routed bandwidth.</blockquote>
I've asked them for an explanation and will post their response!

Update - I received their explanation. Here it is:
<blockquote>To answer your question specifically, "Shortpath" bandwidth refers to (mt) Media Temple's peering relationship with many of the premiere ISPs throughout the Internet.  Our network is currently directly peered with AT&T/Yahoo DSL, Adelphia, Earthlink, Cox Communications, and Japan Telecom.

This means that if someone who uses e.g. Adelphia for their Internet connection, wants to look at your site, then that traffic only travels through our network and Adelphia's.  It never goes outside to the Internet.  As a result, transfers will be faster, and we can also monitor it better.</blockquote>
