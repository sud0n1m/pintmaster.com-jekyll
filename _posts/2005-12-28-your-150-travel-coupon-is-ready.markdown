Was Expedia hacked? I only have about 6 datapoints for reference. I use multiple email addresses to sign up for websites. I generally have a single use email address for a website. Well, I found it pretty strange when I received the following email (Images removed). What was fishy about this is it was sent to my single use expedia address. My dad also received the same email at his address signed up with expedia. My mom - who is not signed up with expedia did not receive it. I also did not receive this email at 100 other possible email addresses they could send it to! Very strange. Has anyone else seen this email that is either NOT an expedia subscriber, or even is one?

Update: I found this page at expedia which indicates that at one point there was a <a href="http://www.expedia.com/daily/promos/vacations/Holiday-and-Getaway-2005/default.asp?CCheck=1&mcecid=BOBO_ext3&affcid=41535750">similar legitimate offer</a>:

Update: Upon checking my Expedia account, the offer is legitimate. Is expedia deliberately trying to make it look like a phishing expedition to dissuade people from taking the offer? All of the links go to expediamail but purport to be from expedia. VERRRRY SKETCHY! The deal isnt even that good - you have to book a hotel + car or hotel + flight or car+ hotel or car + hotel + flight for 4 or more nights.
