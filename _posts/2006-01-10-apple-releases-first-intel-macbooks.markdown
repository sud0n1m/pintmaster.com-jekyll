At the Keynote earlier today, Steve Jobs announced the February availability of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Macbook</a>, Apple's new version of the Powerbook based on the Intel dual core mobile chips. As soon as I get verification that you can dual boot the suckers and load windows on them, I am getting one. I have been waiting for a reason to get a laptop instead of desktop at work. This, I believe is it.
