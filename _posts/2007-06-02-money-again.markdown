<h3>Money is the root of all my stresses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because of my lack of money, I can&rsquo;t justify getting in a long term lease which means I have to endure the stress of moving around a lot. (I&rsquo;m trying to get that fixed by September 1st.)</li>
<li>
Because of my lack of money, Im screwed if something in my house in Houston breaks, and I need to find new tenants!</li>
<li>
Because of my lack of money, Im constantly having to figure out how to move around funds to make sure my bills get paid</li>
<li>
Because of my lack of money, I have to spend time doing less convenient things to avoid spending more.</li>
<li>
Because of my lack of money, Im distracted from doing what I really need to be doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stress to everyone out there enough, that if you decide to bootstrap, pay off everything first&hellip; and I mean everything. What you have to realize is that once you leave your job, your cash-flow shrinks to a crawl. When I was working, I was buying things for the company, going on business lunches. My income was somewhere around $4000 a month, but my revolving balance on my credit card was more like $5000 a month on average&hellip; I always had a lot of cash coming in and going out which meant that when I had a bill to pay, I more than likely would have that cash. Now, I&rsquo;ve got 0 (or close to that) coming in every month, so if I get an unexpected bill (like an old $300 dentist bill from 2006 that my insurance didnt pay), it means I have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to move money around to pay it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll always have old dentist bills and the like creep up on you. I really can&rsquo;t stress it enough: Don&rsquo;t try to be clever and move debt to zero percent (for one full year) credit cards like I did, just pay the stuff off before you leave your job. Bootstrap first, then quit.<br />

Lesson learned. </strong></p>
