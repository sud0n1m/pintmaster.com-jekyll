His soft, almost wussy singing voice is addicting and hypnotic. Their current album, "Plans" is an album where you wont be tempted to skip to the next track. Every track has its own merits and is good in its own right. I wont go as far as to call it musical genius, however if you've got a musically attuned ear and an active brain, you'll probably pick up on the deeper patterns in the way the different instruments fit together.</div>
I usually listen to music based on mood. Death Cab for Cutie and 'The Postal Service', I can listen to any time. I can drive to it, I can sleep to it, I can sing to it. I just love it. It's music you can get lost in and escape the reality of a boring day at work or a disturbing thought. It also helps me reflect on my day, feel relaxed and optimistic.

Tracks to look out for: Soul Meets Body, I will follow you into the dark, Crooked Teeth.

I get shivers every time I listen to each of those tracks.
