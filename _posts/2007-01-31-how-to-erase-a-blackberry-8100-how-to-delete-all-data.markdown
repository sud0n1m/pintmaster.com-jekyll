I had a problem, and spent some time looking for a solution. Since it was a pain to find out how to erase all my data (hard reset) on a Blackberry 8100 from t-mobile, I thought I would post the process here and save someone some time.

<ol>
	<li>In the device options, click <strong>Security Options.</strong></li>
	<li>Click <strong>General Settings</strong></li>
	<li>Press the <strong>Menu</strong> key.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Wipe Handheld.</strong></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Continue</strong></li>
	<li>Type <strong>blackberry</strong></li>
</ol>

Good luck!
