Im trying to build a media center for my HDTV based around a Mac Mini and RSS feeds for downloadable content. I've tried two methods and I am stuck somewhere in between.

<b>Windows</b>
I installed Windows XP Media Center Edition as well as uTorrent to connect up to my TV feeds. I purchased a remote and IR receiver since there is no driver for the mac mini yet as well as a bluetooth mouse and keyboard. When trying to connect it up to my Panasonic TH42PX50U, it showed a blank screen. I fiddled around with the configuration settings but couldnt get it to display. I then did some research and found that <a href="http://forum.onmac.net/showthread.php?t=931">it doesnt work yet - driver issues</a>

So, I tried OS X

<b>OS X</b>
Contrary to what I had read, OS X will play all of my content. I made a symbolic link from my movies folder to my external harddrive where all my content is and it showed up in Front Row. The playback is really good, and I have no complaints. It seems like one of the few pieces of software to download content from RSS feeds on the mac is Democracy Player. However, it isnt in Universal Binary yet and hogs bandwidth like no tomorrow. So, I cant leave it running all the time.

Neither of these solutions is great right now.

Some of the things I will try:

<b>Windows</b>
If I can get alternate drivers that support DVI to HDMI, then I am set.

<b>OS X</b>
Maybe I can install Windows XP in Parallels and use uTorrent like that. Seems kinda convoluted but it might just work! Alternatively, I can give a lot of money to Democracy Player and ask them nicely for a universal binary.

Wish me luck! Your solutions are always welcome.
