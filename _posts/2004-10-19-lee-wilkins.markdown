I bought my Xbox from a guy named <a href="http://leewilkins.com">Lee Wilkins</a> who introduced me to all these <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Social</a> <a href="http://openbc.com">Networking</a> websites as well as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. Got my Xbox modded and have been using it mainly to <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/">watch TV shows</a> that I used to have to watch either on the computer or by hooking up my Powerbook - it was well worth the $200 investment for the Xbox and the modding and I would highly recommend that to anyone else. Check out <a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/">Xbox Scene</a> for more info. I got a guy called <a href="http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=110544">cYon</a> to do the installation for me.
