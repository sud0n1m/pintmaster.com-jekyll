I decided to return the Mac Mini. It's a cool device and really nice and small, but unfortunately there are a few things holding it back being the "killer media box" that I envisioned it to be:

In OS X (intel)
<ol>
	<li>AC3 only supports stereo - AC3 5.1 crashes front row</li>
	<li>Azureus is a resource hog and not as easy to configure as uTorrent - no other alternative</li>
	<li>Bluetooth range is very poor (not sure if it was my Microsoft Keyboard & Mouse, or the mini</li>
</ol>
In Windows
<ol>
	<li>Everything was fantastic except it doesnt do DVI to HDMI. This killed the deal. The screen goes black when I try and boot Win XP on my TV and the OS doesnt find a screen and fails to boot.</li>
	<li>Internal speaker is always on - this is not a big deal, just a minor annoyance</li>
	<li>IR receiver doesnt work in Windows - no drivers</li>
</ol>
