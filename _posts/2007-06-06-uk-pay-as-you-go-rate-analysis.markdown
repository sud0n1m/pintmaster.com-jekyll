<p>I recently did an analysis on <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/06/01/bali-broadband-roundup/">Bali broadband prices</a>. Im now looking at UK pay as you go rates. Im here for 2 weeks, and want a provider that does the following things</p>
<ul>
<li>Sim only (I have my blackberry from the US)</li>
<li>Cheap rates to the US</li>
<li>Cheap calls to UK mobiles</li>
<li>Inexpensive data is a plus, but not essential</li>
</ul>
<p>UK mobile phone providers make it really difficult to understand their tariffs and price out how much it will cost you per month for your usage. Some providers give you incentives if you top up with at least 10 pounds a month. I&rsquo;ve ignored the incentives from all providers. I want to find out who gives me the best rates for my usage, minus the confusing bulls**t.</p>
<h3>The Rates</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As you can see, for my usage, I&rsquo;ve assessed <a href="http://www.talktalkmobile.co.uk/commerce/servlet/gben-server-PageServer?ARTICLE=MAIN.UK.INTERNET.PORTAL.TTMOBILE.STATIC.TTMOBILE.HOME.MBWLD">Mobile World</a> as the best deal. <a href="http://www.talktalkmobile.co.uk/commerce/servlet/gben-server-PageServer?ARTICLE=MAIN.UK.INTERNET.PORTAL.TTMOBILE.STATIC.TTMOBILE.HOME.FRESH">Fresh Mobile</a> is basically the same thing, minus the international calling. These are both in-house brands from <a href="http://www.carphonewarehouse.com">The Carphone Warehouse</a>. Im off to get my sim card!</p>
