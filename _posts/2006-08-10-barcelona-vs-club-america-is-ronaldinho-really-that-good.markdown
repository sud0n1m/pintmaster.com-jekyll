I attended the awesome double header between Houston Dynamo and LA Galaxy and then FC Barcelona and Club America. My Dynamo season tix got some great seats in section 340 of Reliant Stadium looking down on the ants running around chasing the ball. It was a completely different experience than watching them at Robertson Stadium at U of H. The game was fantastic. Club America scored a goal around the 4th minute and was really taking it to Barcelona. They were putting together some great passes, maintaining possession and looking very dangerous in front of goal. In the 75th minute, we left because I was feeling kinda sick and didnt want to get stuck in traffic. BIG MISTAKE! From 4 - 1 down, Barca came back and scored 3 goals to equalize! I heard that Ronaldinho raised his game and showed some amazing skill, drawing a penalty and scoring a goal in the process. Did you find me yet?

What a shame we left early!
