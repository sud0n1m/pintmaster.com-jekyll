There have been a lot of speculators on the net as to why you would need to dual boot / run both Windows XP and OS X on an Intel Mac. Aside from my personal preference for OS X and Unix based systems, Here are my lists why I need each one for work:

Reasons I need OS X:
<ol>
	<li>Presentations - Keynote is miles ahead of powerpoint. I can copy and paste from illustrator, drop in pdfs and the transitions are gorgeous. We have received many WOWs from customers when using Keynote</li>
	<li>PDFs - I generate reports where I have Excel files embedded in Word Documents. In windows, the colors in the embedded excel file dont print. In my Mac in Office 2004... no problem!</li>
	<li>Unix - I sometimes administer the company Debian web server. Running xwindows on Mac OS X, I am able to load up xemacs on the server or other x based programs. I doesnt work as easily using free software for windows.</li>
</ol>
Reasons I need Windows:
<ol>
	<li>Microsoft Access - I use it as a front end for SQL Server 2000. I havent found a good alternative where I can easily copy and paste data into excel</li>
	<li>Microsoft Outlook - the mac email client (corrected: Microsoft Entourage) doesnt cut it when talking to Exchange server 2003</li>
	<li>Windows File Sharing - There are a bunch of great websites like <a href="http://www.macwindows.com">macwindows</a> that tell you how to connect your mac to a windows domain. It seems like every update from apple breaks the connection. Not to mention if you are on wireless and it drops! The samba / windows file sharing support in Windows is a lot more resilient. P.s. I am on a Windows Server 2003 domain which seems to have more trouble than earlier versions</li>
</ol>
Im sure I can find a bunch more if I think about it, but these are the ones that are in the forefront of my mind every time I try to totally switch to one or the other.
