Here is a stupid forward I got on Yahoo! Messenger about a supposed virus. Can anyone confirm this is actually a virus and not a hoax? Even if it was, use Gaim on windows or linux and AdiumX on the Mac and you wont be getting any viruses.
<blockquote>If a Marc James wants to add you to their list dont accept it. Its a virus. Tell everyone on your list because if somebody on your list adds them you will get it too. It is a hard drive killer and a very horrible virus. Please pass this on to everyone on your list. We need to find out who is using this accounts. Sorry for the inconvenience. Right click on your group name of your buddy list and click Send Message to all. Copy and paste this message</blockquote>
