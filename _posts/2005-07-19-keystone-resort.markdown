The parents finally sold their place at Keystone Resort - at a loss if  you consider all of the fees and upkeep over the past few years. What a scam... They really decided to flood the market with new properties so that those who purchased homes previously got screwed. Glad to be out of there - would recommend if you are looking at resort property, stay away from Keystone - or probably any other resort owned by Vail Corporation.
