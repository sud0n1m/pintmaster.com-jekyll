Boing Boing <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/24/old_fbi_memo_its_a_w.html">has an article about It's a Wonderful Life being classified as commie propaganda</a> in 1947 by the FBI. Hilarious, but probably not at the time... I wonder what we will look back on in 60 years and say was ridiculous about 2006?
