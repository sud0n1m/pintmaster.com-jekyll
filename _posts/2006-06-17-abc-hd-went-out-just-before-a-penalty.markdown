Im currently watching the Ghana - Czech Republic game and there is some bad weather outside. I see the Ghana striker go down in the box and have a penalty called and then the image stutters... then nothing. The signal is dead. I hope it comes back for a few seconds and then decide - change to analog. It's 3 or so minutes later and ABC-HD is still out. Time warner must be lying when they say that the weather doesnt affect cable. It certainly seems to be doing it today. I had just written a complaint letter to ESPN / ABC about the poor coverage of the world cup and should have included this latest problem:
<blockquote>Overall, I am very disappointed with the world cup 2006 coverage. The big issues are: No espn2HD on Time Warner Cable. Large on-screen graphics that obstruct the play (see how BBC-HD in the UK has done it), and unknowledgable commentators - Most of what comes out of the mouths of the commentators is incorrect or utter nonsense. This is a really weak effort for such a big event.</blockquote>
The signal going out just before a penalty is something that every football fan fears. Luckily I had the analog signal to switch over to.

p.s. 10 minutes later the HD signal is still out.
