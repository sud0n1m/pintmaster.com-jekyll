I got my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=033">Optical Desktop Elite for Bluetooth¬Æ</a> today and hooked it up to my Mac Mini. The bluetooth doesnt even reach to my couch! What gives! The total distance from the mac mini to my couch is about 8 feet. The advertisement says the bluetooth mouse and keyboard stretches 30 ft. If I use the mouse any further than 4 feet, it gets jerky. If I use the keyboard further than 5 feet, it drops strokes. This is a terrible product - something is wrong - either the bluetooth in the Mac Mini has no range, or the Optical Desktop Elite has no range. Either way I am really disappointed. I will be trying the apple mouse and keyboard for comparison.
