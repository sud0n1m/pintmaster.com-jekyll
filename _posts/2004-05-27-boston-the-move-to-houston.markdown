 I am in Boston until the 30th after a short stint in NJ at Veronique's parents place. She is definitely moving to Houston which I am extremely excited about. I was with her when she got her <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum10.html">first car</a> in the states ( <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum10.html">A cute silver Mazda Miata</a> ). I will be flying to NJ in August to drive to Houston with her. I updated my pictures with some from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum9.html">Graduation.</a> If you are looking for <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim">pictures from my trip</a>, there should definitely be something up there on June 14. 
      <p>In the meantime, enjoy the pictures that Kristian put up on his site of the move from <a href="http://claygate.net/spring2004move.php">Albany to Houston</a> as well as a slightly odd video taken very late at night entitled &quot;<a href="http://claygate.net/nosleep.avi">No Sleep in Kentucky</a>&quot; </p>
