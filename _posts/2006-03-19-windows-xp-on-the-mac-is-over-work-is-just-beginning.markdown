Wow, what a fantastic week. I am really excited that I have <a href="http://onmac.net">windows running on my Mac</a> now. The week has been super busy and I've had barely any time for Veronique or for my day job. It's crazy, especially since I will be travelling next week. The rate of progress since the solution came out is immense. Just looking at the <a href="http://wiki.onmac.net">wiki</a> and watching it grow was incredible. Not to mention all of the activity in the chat room and the <a href="http://forum.onmac.net">forums</a> . Im looking forward to continuing my support of development and assisting those involved in any way I can.
