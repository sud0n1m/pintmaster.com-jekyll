Myspace is the ridiculously popular social networking site now owned by Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch. There are tons of people on myspace and oodles of hot girls and guys. People browse through profiles all the time to check their owners out. We are obsessed with learning about strangers. So, how do you maximize your profile so strangers will obsess over you? Read on!

<strong><img align="right" id="image189" alt="my myspace profile pic" src="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/937038063_m.thumbnail.jpg" />The profile image</strong>

This is essentially the first point of attraction. It's gotta be catchy and it's gotta be good. If you are attractive, focus in on it. If you are not attractive, it's really important to make it interesting. Im OK looking, but I decided to take a really crazy picture with my Photo Booth on my Mac and use that. On a page filled with profile images, mine definitely stands out enough that people will look a little longer. The pic doesnt have to be of you, but people are less likely to click if it is your dog or a beer bottle

<strong>Other Pics</strong>

With your other pictures, you want to show a wide range of things going on. Show yourself partying with lots of different people. Go out for a few nights and bring a camera with you. If you're a girl, take pictures with lots of different guys. If you're a guy, lots of different girls. The better looking the other people are in your pics, the better you look & the more fun you look like you're having. If you seem like a fun person, then people will want to get to know you.

<strong>The profile</strong>

So, you want to cast the widest net so that people will relate to you. No no no! Be certain about what you like, but also be a little vague in your details. If you lay out your entire life in your profile, there is nothing left for people to learn about you. Avoid the "I grew up in Plainsboro NJ and moved to blah blah blah". That's boring as heck. Make yourself mysterious and intriguing. Instead of saying you are a regional sales representative for xyz widget company, make a joke and say you are a professional superhero. Get imaginative and make it interesting.

<strong>Themes</strong>

People go all out with their themes on myspace. Im not a big fan of them, but that is just a personal preference. If you do put up a theme, make sure it doesnt take away from the functionality of your page. If people cant read it or use it, it's useless. Also stay away from too many flashing images. That wasnt cool on the net in the 90s and it isnt cool now.

<strong>Friends</strong>

Make sure you have a good base of existing friends on your profile. I would say that 20 - 30 is probably the minimum you want. Dont go around myspace asking everyone to be your friend so that you end up with 400 friends. You are not Tom. Get your friends to give you credibility by writing on your page and commenting on your pics. The more other people have to say about you, the more cred you get. It's kind of like a seal of approval. If you have a really good friend, make sure they dont bombard your page. You want to show variety and depth.

Once you've built up your profile, you're ready to go and meet people! <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/index.php/20060812/how-to-be-popular-on-myspace-part-2/">Tune in next time to learn how.</a>
