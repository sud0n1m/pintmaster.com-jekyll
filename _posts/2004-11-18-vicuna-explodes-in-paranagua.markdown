We hadnt heard about it at the time, but apparently there was a tragic accident where a ship discharging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol">Methanol</a> exploded in the port, right next to the <a href="http://www2.petrobras.com.br/ingles/index.asp">Petrobras</a> terminal - which had tanks full of petroleum. The damage was pretty substantial with the ship being ripped in half, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Oil-leak-in-Brazilian-port-after-ship-explosion/2004/11/18/1100718127631.html?oneclick=true">is continuing</a> and there are reports that 2 people are dead. Originally, it was feared that all 31 crewmembers on the ship were dead. You can see from the damage in the <a href="http://news.search.yahoo.com/search/news?p=vicuna&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&toggle=1&ei=UTF-8&c=news_photos&datesort=1">pictures</a> why they may have feared that. It has been hard to find a lot of information about this, and the reports are vague and contradictory. <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N15659541.htm">Here</a> <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-11/16/content_2226792.htm">are</a> <a href="http://www.mgn.com/news/hpndetails.cfm?id=17373">a</a> <a href="http://afr.com/articles/2004/11/18/1100718131647.html">few</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsurance.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?newsId=4669">articles</a> about what happened
