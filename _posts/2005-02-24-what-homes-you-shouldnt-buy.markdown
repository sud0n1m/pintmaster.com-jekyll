I am currently looking for an apartment close to downtown Houston and I stumbled upon this article in the Houston Press <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/2005-02-24/news/feature_1.html">about the poor quality of Perry Homes</a>. The article has a very negative slant about how Perry & other suburban developers are bringing their crap into the city. I have to say, that from a price point of view, these townhomes and new blocks of apartments look appealing, but this article just reassures me that as good a price as they may seem, they will have problems and older is better.

<blockquote>The Dead Zone 	
Houston buries its Inner Loop past under bright new shiny Perry Homes town houses
BY JOSH HARKINSON

He called them "the little houses." They were the shotgun shacks and decomposing Victorians, the flophouses where the panhandlers crashed and the drug dealers weighed rock. Along the crabgrass yards of the Fourth Ward slum, they bred the kind of crime and poverty unheard of in Rich Agnew's Clear Lake subdivision. Yet walking the narrow streets with a realtor, Agnew could hardly see them.

Instead, he saw uniform brick facades reminiscent of new row houses in old London. Sidewalks striated to resemble cobblestones led him past young shrubs planted with cookie-cutter precision. The realtor ushered Agnew through the door of a new model town house, one among hundreds sporting vanity rooms, granite countertops and shiny wood floors.

An uppermost window gave Agnew and his wife a glimpse of the downtown skyline. The middle-aged couple imagined an exciting life of freedom from their commute, lawn mower and energy bills. But they wanted this lifestyle without the chaos of inner Houston's urban hodgepodge; they feared losing the programmed, suburban feel of the Perry Homes neighborhood where they had raised kids.

And that's why Sutton Square, one of Perry's new urban versions of the suburbs, was almost perfect. </blockquote>
