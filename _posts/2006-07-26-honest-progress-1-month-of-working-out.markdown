Alright, so I was getting chubby before. I started working out - 5 - 7 times a week. I go to the gym 4 - 5, and play soccer 2 times. I started (as of last week) going biking one day a week too with a friend. Im feeling in great shape. But, it's all about <em>looking</em> good in a bikini :) - or just at the beach.

Here are some shots (deliberately unflattering) of my progress thus far. I've lost an inch around the waist (damn pants are too big), my arms are bigger and I am starting to get definition. I am not quite at the flat stomach and rock hard abs stage yet. Check back in another month!
