Does sugar cause pimples?

I have a zit on my chin. I dont usually get zits on my chin except when I eat lots of sugary foods. Now, let me explore why this could happen. I think there are a few scenarios here that are causing the zit so before I completely blame sugar, let's look at a few:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Sugar </strong>It's the damn sugar!</li>
	<li><strong>Hormone</strong> imbalances make me crave sugar and also cause the zits - therefore attributing it to sugar is a logical fallacy.</li>
	<li><strong>Dietary Change</strong> It's the other ingredients in the things that contain sugar (I've been eating ice cream, chocolate chip cookies and drinking coke).</li>
	<li><strong>Personal Hygiene</strong> - Has my personal hygiene been poor (NO! I still wash my face twice a day)</li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
Alright, so looking at these few options, the one that makes the most sense is Dietary change. Assuming the amount of food intake stays the same, by eating more sugary / junk food, the less healthy diet means that the body is more prone to making evil zits. What do you think?
