I've been receiving email solicitations for Motor Trend Magazine. These are sent by Primedia, a New York, NY based company. They use a service called cheetahmail to send out their email direct marketing. Unfortunately Cheetahmail doesn't seem to be able to unsubscribe me. I've done it 5 times! So, that's their fault and I've filed a complaint with the FTC. If you have this problem, do the same. It's the only way to get them to stop!
