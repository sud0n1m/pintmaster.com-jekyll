I recently broke my 3g Ipod 30 gb after dropping it on a corner on the tile floor in my apartment. I am now looking for an aftermarket enclosure for it. For your guidance - <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1042924&CatId=1204">this one</a> does not work. I have seen many people suggesting using it on Ipod lounge and the Apple support website but I havent gotten wind of any enclosures that work with the Ipod harddrive. If you know anything different, please let me know!!!
