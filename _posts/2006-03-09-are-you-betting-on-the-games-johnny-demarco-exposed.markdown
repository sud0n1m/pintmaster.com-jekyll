We've been getting some phone calls at the office on one of our lines from Johnny Demarco - <a href="http://www.johnnydemarco.com/">not this guy</a> - at first it is a recorded call with some high energy guy saying that Johnny DeMarco predicted last weeks game perfectly blah blah blah. Well, it's annoying.

The way this guy does it is he has a bunch of screeners who answer the calls after the recorded message (if you press 0) and then they ask you "are you betting on the games" and you say something like "I've been know to place bets occasionally, what do you guys have to offer" and then they say - please hold because you look like a potential sucker.

Well John L. Edens of Atlanta, GA aka Johnny DeMarco - email is john@johnedens.com - Here are <a href="http://bettorsworld.com/web/forums/search.php?searchid=141401">all your forum posts on bettorsworld.com</a> one of your haunts
