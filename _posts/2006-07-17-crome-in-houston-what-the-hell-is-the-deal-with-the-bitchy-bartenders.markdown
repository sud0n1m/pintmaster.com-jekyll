So, I went to Crome on Sunday evening. It's a nice place and they charge $10 cover to get in (surprising for a sunday!). When you get there it is pretty packed. A lot of people migrate from La Strada around 5 - 6 o'clock. The bar was cool - very nice with white "VIP" couches outside - reminded me a lot of Pangia in Marbella. Now here is the part where I bitch and moan :). There was a bar at the far side of the outside where there were these two 30-something women (they could have been 20-something with too much sun, cigs and alcohol I suppose) working the bar. I went up there and asked them for a club soda since I am no longer drinking. They poured it and said "$3". I said "you're not gonna make me pay for that are you?". They just said "leave us a nice tip" and I said "keep being nice to me and I will". So, I grabbed me drink without paying and walked away.

Fair enough, I had to talk my way out of paying with these bitches. So I walked inside and hung out for a bit and then my drink was empty. So, I figured... I want to give these bitches a tip & I went back out. I said, "could I get another club soda please". She poured the drink, rang it up and looked at me deadpan and said "$3". I said "that's not very nice" and she said "$3". I said "you guys are horrible" and handed over $5. She rang me up and said "do you want to stay here?". I said "what?". She said "if you want to stay here, you had better not call us horrible". I said nothing and walked away.

So I guess I cant be that pissed - I didnt get kicked out. Frankly I would have been surprised to be kicked out for calling the horrible bartenders "horrible" for charging me for soda water.

The blonde (short w/ bad face) and brunette (taller w/ bad face) behind the counter have such a small circle of influence that pretty much extends to the four corners of Crome and in reality, they probably dont even have all of that. It's just sad when people try and abuse what little power they have.

All in all, it is a nice place. They just need to fix their policy on non-alcoholic drinks. I have never been charged for Soda Water more than one glass, and I dont expect to be - especially by somewhere that charges cover on a sunday! Crome - if you want to be seen with other people posing as rich and trendy, it's the place to be.
