Google Docs & Spreadsheets are now available at <a title="docs.google.com" href="http://docs.google.com">docs.google.com</a>. This is the first time we are seeing a rebranded <a title="writely" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writely#Writely">writely</a> combined with Google's spreadsheets to form the basis for Google's foray into the realm of office software. I imagine it wont take much before this could be used to create nearly every document in academia. With the autosaving feature, there would be no room for the excuse that your harddrive crashed!
