The wind has started to pick up now. It is raining on and off. It just feels ominous outside. 

I decided to tape up the east and north facing windows with Duck Tape. I dont know that it will really do anything, but at least it makes me feel like I have done everything I could. It seems that the Hurricane is continuing on its path to make landfall at Port Arthur / Beaumont - about 120 miles or so from Houston. This looks a lot better for us, but not so good for those in Port Arthur / Beaumont. I didnt hear anything on the TV yet about them being evacuated, so I am not sure if most are still there. I visited a chevron blend plant in Beaumont about a month ago and there is not that much there... just a bunch of refineries, but the devastation to that area Im sure will be tremendous, just not as bad as a direct hit on Houston. 

We had dinner a little while ago. I made chicken with spinach and asparagus. Im not sure when we will have our electric stove again, and am wishing that I had a gas stove other than my barbeque grill downstairs. 

Everyone here is worried about the looting. I know nick had tried to get a shotgun. I would like to have one too. A couple of signs we have seen so far are "You Loot, We Shoot" and "Protected by Smith and Wesson" in front of peoples houses. I think it might be a good idea to put a sign outside as a deterrent to people to come in to our house.

All this waiting is really frustrating. Come on already Rita. We're ready for you to come, if only because that means we are closer to you leaving.
