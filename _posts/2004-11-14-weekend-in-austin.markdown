She was super tired after her third week in her new job, so we left on Saturday after breakfast at <a href="http://www.houstoneats.com/Restaurant%20Reviews/Best%20Values/Review-Chachos.htm">Chachos</a>. We were in a stinky and empty pub at 3:30 and after a pint, decided to go to eat at <a href="http://www.trudys.com/">Trudy's Texas Star</a>. Austin Scott from <a href="http://www.tasis.com/">Tasis</a> was down from Canada working for a few months so we hung out together since we havent seen each other in a few years. 
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum16.html">Here are the pictures</a> from the evening. It was really enjoyable to be able to park the car and then walk to all the bars. A nice change from H-town. I am looking forward to Kristian moving to Houston in the next few weeks so then we can terrorize downtown. Expect pictures when we do that.

It looks like Kristian <a href="http://claygate.net/nov2004.php">posted pictures also</a>
