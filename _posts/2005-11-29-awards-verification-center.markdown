I got a postcard from Awards Verification Center - 2400 W. Pioneer Pkwy, Suite 210 Arlington, TX 76013 and found a hilarious post by a guy who went there just to mess with them. The company seems to be Silverleaf Resorts who also <a href="http://www.fighttelemarketing.com/silverleaf.html">doesnt seem to respect telemarketing laws</a>, <a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:xqvCCXizxYMJ:www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2002/EB-02-TC-256.pdf">got busted by the FCC</a> and has numerous <a href="http://www.dallas.bbb.org/commonreport.html?compid=8000090&code=">complaints at the Dallas Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a>

I really like how <a href="http://www.clowncarblog.com/archives/000611.html">this guy</a> dealt with them. It never astounds me at how stupid American society is to aid and abett a company as corrupt and greedy as this one grow to a Market cap of 88 million. This should be a penny stock, not a $2 stock. These guys have 23 million in net income. This crap drives me crazy.
