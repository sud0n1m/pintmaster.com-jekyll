As posted on <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/19/1712258&tid=95&tid=123">slashdot</a>, it looks like <a href="http://www.suprnova.org">Suprnova</a> is gone for good.  So is some other site called torrentbits.org. Here is the message from the people at suprnova:

<blockquote>Greetings everybody,

 As you have probably noticed, we have often had downtimes. This was because it was so hard to keep this site up!
 But now we are sorry to inform you all, that SuprNova is closing down for good in the way that we all know it.
 We do not know if SuprNova is going to return, but it is certainly not going to be hosting any more torrent links.
 We are very sorry for this, but there was no other way, we have tried everything.

 Thank you all that helped us, by donating mirrors or something else, by uploading and seeding files, by helping people out on IRC and on forum, by spreading the word about SuprNova.org.
 It is a sad day for all of us!

 Please visit SuprNova.org every once in a while to get the latest news on what is happening and if there is anything new to report on.

 As we wish to maintain the nice comunity that we created, we are keppig forums and irc servers open.

 Thank you all and Goodbye!
 sloncek & the rest of the SuprNova Team</blockquote>

It looks like, Bittorrent will count for a little bit less than <a href="http://in.tech.yahoo.com/041103/137/2ho4i.html">35% of all net traffic</a> with Suprnova gone. What a sad, sad day.
