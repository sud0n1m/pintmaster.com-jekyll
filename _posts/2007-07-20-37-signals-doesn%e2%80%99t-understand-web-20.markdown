<p>I was reading a review by <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/03/20/review-highrise-part-2">Robby on Rails about Highrise</a>. One of the responders, <a href="http://livinginsmallsizes.com/">Will</a> had this to say about 37 Signals:</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesnâ€™t make sense to me. On the web (2.0) the mantra is integration, and yet here we have a single company releases compartmentalized applications that are an ideal extension of one another.</p></blockquote>
