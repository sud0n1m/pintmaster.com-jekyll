I am sitting here in London now, home for the holidays and I brought my <a href="http://www.packet8.net">packet 8</a> VOIP phone with me. To my surprise, it works! It actually works pretty well. I have made about 4 or 5 phone calls and received 2. No one has complained about the quality. My parents have a DSL connection versus my cable modem. I have found that the quality is actually better on their slower dsl connection in England, probably due to the way in which the cable networks operate and how packets generally go through in bursts. I think I am going to get my parents one and send it to them. That way, they can call me or anyone else in the states for free.
