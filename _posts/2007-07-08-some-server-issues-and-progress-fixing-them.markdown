<p><a href="http://slicehost.com"><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/slicehost.thumbnail.png" alt="Slicehost" align="left" /></a>I have this site running on a <a href="http://slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> VPS. I have <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/05/10/overpromise-underdeliver-a-recipe-for-disaster/">previously raved about</a> Slicehost. About a week ago I started to notice the site going down. To know when that happens, I use a free service called <a href="http://montastic.com/">Montastic</a>. Montastic will alert me by email if my site (or up to 9 others) go down. This is great when you have to maintain multiple sites across multiple servers (or if you want to know if someone else dropped the ball!). <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/08/some-server-issues-and-progress-fixing-them/#more-113">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
