Have you been trying to figure out how to keep your Windows up to date so you dont spread viruses, but are concerned that if you update, Windows will stop working?

<a href="http://www.p2plife.com/forums/Official_muBlinder_Page-t320.html">muBlinder</a> is a piece of software that allows you to bypass Microsoft's Genuine Advantage check and download their software - such as Windows Desktop Search 3.0, Windows Defender, Internet Explorer 7.0 (which breaks Outlook 2003). It's available and update from the <a href="http://www.p2plife.com/forums/Official_muBlinder_Page-t320.html">p2plife forums</a> (unfortunately you need to register to download it), but the solution works, and is relatively easy to update. Another solution that doesnt allow you to download the extras is <a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/">WindizUpdate</a>, a plugin for firefox that replicates the way Windows Update works.
