I joined up with Mediatemple's Gridserver product a couple of months ago because of the very high value proposition posed by the company. I can host all of my sites with Mediatemple and because it is on a cluster of servers, I should have higher uptime and very few problems. Well, the technology is theoretically better but is very new, so naturally, they are having teething problems. This site has had a lot of downtime recently and Mediatemple has done the right thing by me and probably most of their gridserver customers and given 2 months of service as a concession for the troubles. 

Thanks Mediatemple. I was frustrated, but gave you the benefit of the doubt that these were early bugs. We're now back on track for me to recommend your service to others!
