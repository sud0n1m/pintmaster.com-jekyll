From Techcrunch:


<blockquote>According to Kevin there are two models, 4 GB and 8 GB, priced at $249 and $449. No word on whether theyâ€™ll be shipping an unlocked version of the phone as Om Malik recently reported, but Kevin says Apple is adding both GSM and CDMA radios into the iPhone, making it truly carrier-independent. The device will have a slide out keyboard, a touch screen and two batteries (one for the MP3 player, one for the phone).</blockquote>
