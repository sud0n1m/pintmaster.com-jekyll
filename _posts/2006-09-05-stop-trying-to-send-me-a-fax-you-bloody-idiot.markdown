Im not sure if Verizon, Sprint, Cingular etc... do. So, basically, I just have to sit and listen to my phone ring 10 times a day as some idiot from france tries to send me a fax on my phone. I know they are from france because it is country code +33 - well that is what the caller ID says anyway.

So, after being awoken by the phone ringing this morning, I looked over and it was the same damn number! So, being completely sick of this crap, I called up T-mobile waited on hold for only 5 mins or so after the stupid machine couldnt understand that I wanted to block a phone number, not check how many minutes I had used. I then talked to a rep who proceeded to tell me that they are not able to block a number, they can only change mine. That is ridiculous! That's like the doctor saying - sorry, we cant treat individual cuts, we can only amputate limbs!?!?!

One would think that in this day and age, a company like t-mobile would be able to block individual numbers that are harassing their customers. Get your shit together tmo! You are on notice!
