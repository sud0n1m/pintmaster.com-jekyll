In this video, an American AH-64 Apache Helicopter watches two insurgents from two miles away. They identify them as having weapons (an RPG launcher maybe) and take them out with their M230, 30mm gun. Its amazing how removed from the whole thing the guys in the helicopter are. Even though it seems like a video game, you can hear the heart rate racing in the soldiers as they talk back and forth.
