Tomorrow I will be dumber. Im getting my "wisdom" teeth out. Im kinda nervous because it's a pretty gross thing to have four teeth yanked out. Not to mention I dont like the dentist. Im lucky that Liza Zuzek will be taking care of me afterwards and driving me to her place. I'll have to stop to get ice cream on the way home. If I have general anesthetic, I will be pretty out of it until Sunday probably. Uh oh!

And, out of curiosity, my co-pay on my wisdom teeth is around $1100. How much did other people have to pay?
