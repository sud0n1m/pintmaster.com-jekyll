Im bummed today because it is raining which means soccer is cancelled because they dont want to ruin the fields. My team made it through to the 3rd round of the Memorial Cup, and it is a little disappointing to not be able to play today. This means we will play in a couple of weeks time since Thanksgiving is next weekend.
