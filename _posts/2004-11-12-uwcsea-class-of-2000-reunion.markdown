I received the following email with information from Nikki Lindman. I dont think I will be able to make it, but if you are able to go, please let me know how it turns out and take lots of pictures!!!

<blockquote>Don¬ít know if it has crossed your mind at any point ¬ñ but next year it will have been 5 years since we graduated from UWCSEA. Now I hope you agree, but I think its high-time for a mass Singapore reunion!!

So, what I am suggesting is this - Put in your diaries now the weekend of 23/24 July 2005 and come hell or high water get yourself to Singapore for that weekend ¬ñ start saving up, robbing banks etc. I¬íll arrange a venue as we get closer to the date and then we can all meet up and have a fabulous time!!
YAY!

This is by no means exclusive to just our year ¬ñ lets just get as many people together in one place at one time as possible!

I have sent this email out to as many UWCSEA addresses as I could lay my hands on but please forward this out and spread the word!

Also could you just reply and let me know if you are keen so I can gauge interest!

Looking forward to hearing from you and more importantly, seeing
you!

Much love,
Heron
