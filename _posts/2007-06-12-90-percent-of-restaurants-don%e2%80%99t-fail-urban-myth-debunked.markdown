<p>I met a good friend of mine for dinner tonight and we got to talking about life goals and ambitions. It turns out that he is a fantastic cook and lots of people who have tried his food tell him he should open his own restaurant. We talked a little bit about the specifics. My friend wants to combine all of his interests and has a vision for a really fantastic restaurant. He was discouraged to do it because of the high failure rate of restaurants. <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/06/12/90-percent-of-restaurants-dont-fail-urban-myth-debunked/#more-76">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
