Google is the gorilla in the room and offers great tools to track the conversions of other systems. Unfortunately, I cant give you specific numbers. I can tell you that Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are all within 1 - 2 percentage points of each other. Looksmart is around 10% lower than the others on conversions.  <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/23/click-fraud-rampant-on-looksmart/#more-150">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
