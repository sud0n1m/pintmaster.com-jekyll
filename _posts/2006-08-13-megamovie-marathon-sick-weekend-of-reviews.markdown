Since I am sick this weekend, I have been watching quite a few movies. I figure that I should try and do something productive with it so Im going to share my opinions of the movies:

<strong>The Benchwarmers</strong>

The benchwarmers is one of those lame underdog movies. It's basically about a bunch of losers whose goal as adults is to beat a bunch of kids baseball teams. It has the usual SNL guys - Rob Schneider, David Spade as well as Jon Heder of "Napoleon Dynamite" fame. However, this movie is terrible. It is cheesy, predictable and fails to maintain attention through the movie. It has a few funny parts, but basically it is disappointing. Maybe it works if you are a bunch of teenagers at a slumber party. Anyone else, leave it on the shelf

3/10

<strong>Basic Instinct 2</strong>

This is the raunchy sequel to the leg-uncrossing Basic Instinct. Sharon Stone is older and raunchier. It is set in London, probably to try and make it more interesting. I can half pay attention to the movie when they start talking dirty or have a graphic sex scene. The car that she crashes at the beginning is pretty interesting. Overall, the movie was more interesting than Benchwarmers, but I would still refrain from giving it good marks.

5/10

<strong>Ultraviolet</strong>

Decent special effects, poor story and really fails to set the mood to give the viewer the full feeling of the dystopian future. The idea is that there are people infected with a virus who are stronger, heal faster etc... than humans, but they also die faster. The humans are trying to eradicate these infected people from the general population. Violet is one of the infected and wants to prevent the humans from killing all of the infected. It's another comic book made into movie. It isnt interesting enough in the transfer and I would be pretty bored seeing it again.

4/10

<strong>Inside Man</strong>

Fantastic Spike Lee movie about a bank robbery in New York city. It has the usual Spike Lee racial undertones.¬† It has a really interesting cast - Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, Jodie Foster. The cast makes for a really interesting dynamic. The story reminds of "The Usual Suspects" and flashes back and forth between times as the hostages in the bank robbery are being interviewed. Unlike "The Usual Suspects", the viewer is more omnipotent, and only the Detective (Washington) has the epiphany moment when he realizes 'whodunnit'. It's certainly one that slipped under my radar, and is more interesting than a lot of crud that hollywood has pumped out. Nice one spike!
