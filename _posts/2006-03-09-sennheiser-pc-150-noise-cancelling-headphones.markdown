<strong>Pros: </strong>Price, Audio Quality, Great bass response, Microphone built in<a title="Buy on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DCRHA/onmacnet-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=1HH0B9YWDHMPV67C8YM7&link_code=as1"><img align="right" title="Sennheiser PC-150" id="image130" alt="Sennheiser PC-150" src="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/sennheiser.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<strong>Cons: </strong>They mess up my hair

I got these the other day after reading some reviews online. I just wanted to add my $0.02.

These are a great pair of headphones for the money. The sound quality is good at low volume levels. I got them for 2 primary reasons:
<ol>
	<li>Block out  people around me at work</li>
	<li>Talk on Skype</li>
</ol>

I can assure you that they are great for both purposes. I have never been interested in large over the ear headphones because they are too bulky to be portable. These are no different. They are perfect for sitting at your computer and I would challenge anyone to find better desktop speakers sub $40.00. Im not an audiophile, but I love music and I can tell the difference between good and bad headphones. These are definitely the best headphones I have had in a while - much better than the iPod buds, and the Sony replacement buds for my iPod. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a videoconferencing / skyping set of headphones or if you work long hours on your computer listening to music. I imagine they would be great for gaming too, but I have heard there are 5.1 surround headphones that are a little pricier.

After checking pricegrabber, I found the <a title="Sennheiser PC-150" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DCRHA/onmacnet-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=1HH0B9YWDHMPV67C8YM7&link_code=as1">best price for these was on Amazon.com</a>

Cnet also <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11293_7-6246557-2.html?tag=next">mentioned these in an article on creating your own podcast</a> - I might try it!
