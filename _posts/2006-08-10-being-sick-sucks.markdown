Im not sure where or who I got it from. I think I have been overdoing it with socializing and working out. Working out, partying and getting 4 hours of sleep eventually runs you down and allows sickness to move in. Im taking it easy tonight. In fact, i took several naps in the conference room at work today, got some soup for dinner and am already in bed typing this. Im about to cough up a lung. I got this tylenol cough syrup that has acetaminofen (sp?) in it and that seems to help a little.
There's much more soccer to watch and play on the weekend so I want to be in good spirits for that! Cheers to relaxing for a few days!
