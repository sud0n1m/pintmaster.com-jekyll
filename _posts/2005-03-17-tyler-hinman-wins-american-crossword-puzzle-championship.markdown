<img align=left src="http://rpi.edu/homepage/hf-hinman.jpg" alt="Tyler Hinman holds the trophy"  />I first saw this at the <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/web/Campus.News/features/031405-crossword.html">RPI website</a>. It looks like <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/games3/quandary27/">Tyler Hinman</a> from <a href="http://tasis.com">Tasis</a> class of '02 (not the <a href="http://www.tasis2k.com">Tasis Class of 2000</a> like me ) won the American Crossword Puzzle Championship. I had this guy in my Compsci 2 class at RPI and all he did in class was solve crossword puzzles on his computer. I remember sitting a few rows behind (yeah, I am just a few rows cooler :) ) and watching him speed solve puzzles. It was definitely more entertaining than learning about "trees" etc... Well, look at my boy tyler now... all the way from spanish class when we used to chuckle about his crossword tie to this. The champion of the USA; and the youngest one at that! Congratulations Tyler Hinman, Congratulations.
