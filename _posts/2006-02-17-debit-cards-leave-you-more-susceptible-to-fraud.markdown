I just saw on CNBC that Debit Cards are not afforded the same protection by the federal government as are Credit Cards. For example, if you use your debit card at Best Buy and the company that processes Best Buy's transactions loses a laptop with 10 million names, addresses and card numbers, the people who used credit cards are safer. If you use a debit card, it is more difficult to put a hold on your account, and also more difficult to reclaim the money from fraudulent activity. The legislation was passed through the government prior to the widespread use of Visa / Mastercard branded debit cards. Unfortunately, this legislation does not cover these cards. Just remember - if your credit card gets stolen, you are not liable; if your debit card gets stolen, you might be!
