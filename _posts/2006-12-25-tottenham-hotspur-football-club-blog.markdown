I had an interesting meeting tonight over at a family friends house with "The Bagel" from <a href="http://www.beefbagel.com">Beef Bagel</a>. He just happened to run a blog that covers the best team in the English Premier League, <a href="http://spurs.co.uk">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. The blog is an opinion site on the spurs news of the day, and "The Bagel" does a fantastic job of capturing the mood of the fan. Good luck Bagel!
