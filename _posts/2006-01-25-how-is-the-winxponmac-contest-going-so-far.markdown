Thank you for all the support the mac community has shown so far. I spent 5 hours last night after work trying my best to make the update as accurate as possible. Unfortunately I missed a couple of people and for that, I apologize. If I missed you, please send me a nice message asking me to make sure to put you in on the next one!

The contest is going great and it is getting wide coverage around the net. I have had interest expressed by several parties saying they are working on a solution, but no solutions as of yet. If you are working on a solution, please <a href="mailto:imworkingonit@pintmaster.com">let me know</a> so I can keep track of how many people / teams are working on it.

Best of luck to all trying, there are a lot of us counting on you!

Also, on another note, one donor suggested that we set a minimum of $10 to add a link to your website on the page. I dont want to discourage people from donating smaller amounts, however it seems that there are some out there using the site to post junk websites, and links to "get me a free ipod" etc... I dont have the time to check the links, but figure a spammer will be less willing to spend $10 to get their spam link on the site, and a real supporter wont mind not having a link for less than a $10 contribution. This is a learning process, so for everyone who posted a link for $1, dont worry! It will remain on the site. Otherwise, new links cost $10.

Thanks again for everyone's support and sorry to raise the rates on links. I need to keep my sanity! I cant spend 5 hrs a night updating links at $1 a pop.
