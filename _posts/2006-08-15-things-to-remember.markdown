Last night, I came up with a list of things to live by. Im going to carry it around with me wherever I go and add to it when I think of something else. Here it is:
<ol>
	<li>Only you have the power to realize <em>your </em>dreams</li>
	<li>Bulletproof your ideas from the naysayers with guns</li>
	<li>Think as big as you can. Your balls will have to catch up.</li>
	<li>Make only the promises you are able to keep</li>
	<li>Build the reality that you want, but remember you can only do it one brick at a time</li>
	<li>Failure is when you screw up the same way twice</li>
	<li>People will follow you into the depths of hell. Don't be scared - plan accordingly.</li>
	<li>Recognize your shortcomings and arm yourself with people who compensate for them.</li>
</ol>
