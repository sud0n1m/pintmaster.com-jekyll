I dont have chronic bad breath. I get morning breath. I also remember Ryan Pacheco telling me my breath stunk in spanish class<a title="BreathRX" class="imagelink" href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/photo-78.jpg"><img align="right" alt="BreathRX" id="image217" title="BreathRX" src="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/photo-78.thumbnail.jpg" /></a> when we were 13 or 14. I think i have been paranoid since then. Thanks Ryan! Aside from that my breath is ok (as far as I know!). One of the other people in my office was talking about <a href="http://breathrx.com">BreathRX</a>. It's a new product on the market developed by the "Extreme Makeover" dentist, Dr. Bill Dorfman. Well, if that doesnt excite you - then how about this testimony:
<blockquote>The BreathRX system has stopped my breath smelling. I can finally get close to women without making them cringe, and I dont make small children cry anymore.

I can also give my testimony that the stuff works. The really great part is the tongue scraper. I've used tongue scrapers to get the nasty, yellow, smelly plaque-teria (word is my creation) off my tongue. I have used none better than the simple one that comes with BreathRX. Check it out at your local pharmacy - you should be able to pick up a basic kid for $10.
