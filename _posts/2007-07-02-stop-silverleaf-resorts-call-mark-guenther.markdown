I get a lot of people on here who have problems dealing with Silverleaf Resorts, a timeshare company that does a lot of direct marketing. I would encourage unhappy customers to band together and organize. Mark Guenther posted a comment on a previous post.

<blockquote>My name is Mark Guenther and I have been hounded by this company for the last year. I live in the atlanta area and I have been getting these calls about cars and money. I did some research and I have traced what I think is back to chicago. The man I usually get is Bill Carson at 773 465 5370. The reason I am writing is if anyone has recieved one of these blue cards or any address to meet a representitive please email me or call me at 404 579 8189 this is my office line. I would like to put a stop to this. I am not a lawyer but I have the time and the energy to do something</blockquote>

Good luck! If you want me to set up a more organized effort / forum, let me know!
