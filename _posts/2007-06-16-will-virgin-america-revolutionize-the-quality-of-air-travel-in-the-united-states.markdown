<p>I hope so! Since I moved to Houston, I&rsquo;ve been using Continental Airlines primarily. As a carrier they service a lot of cities, offer competetive fares, have good customer service and don&rsquo;t do a lot of the crap other airlines do. Now Virgin America has approval to launch and will be flying San Fran to New York first. Boston is a city they are considering too. Please pick us!</p>
