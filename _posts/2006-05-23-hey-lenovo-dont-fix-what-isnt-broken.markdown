I just bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T60, the second Thinkpad my company has purchased since IBM sold their PC & Laptop division to Lenovo. I was extremely disappointed to find out that the docking system that has been the same as long as I have had a t-series thinkpad, and to be honest, one of the big selling points of the T, is now different!!!
