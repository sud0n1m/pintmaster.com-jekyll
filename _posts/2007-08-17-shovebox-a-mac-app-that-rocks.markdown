The criteria for shameless promotion is high. It&rsquo;s about as high as the criteria for me calling you one of my friends. My friend Dan Grover at Wonderwarp Software just released version 1.0 of his new app <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a> is great name, because that&rsquo;s what the app is. It&rsquo;s a box that you <em>shove </em>stuff in to. It competes in the same class of apps as Yojimbo and Eagle Filer. The <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a> approach is to have a little box in the menu bar like you see below:<br />

<p>When you want to add something, drag and drop it to the box. Organize your notes and clippings later. <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a> allows you to dump your brain when you get a thought or see something interesting. This allows you to focus on the activity at hand.</p>
<p>Basically, I use shovebox to store &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; and Actiontastic to store &ldquo;things I need to do&rdquo;. Shovebox is a great addition to my arsenal. I had been toying with Yojimbo, but couldn&rsquo;t find a reason to justify the $40. $25 for Shovebox is easier to swallow.</p>
<p><strong> Things I&rsquo;d love to be able to store in Shovebox<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords (integration with keychain)</li>
<li>Serial Numbers</li>
<li>Web archive from firefox  (only works w/ Safari now)</li>
</ul>
