<a href="http://wirefly.com">Wirefly.com</a> is like many cell phone resellers online - except it doesnt seem as shady. A lot of the places online have broken images etc... that make you doubt how solid the business is. My company uses blackberry phones that we have through T-Mobile. For fun, I decided to try and configure a plan on T-Mobile to see what kind of deal I could get through wirefly.com. The nice thing about Wirefly is that you are able to make easy comparisons of phones and prices. If you're looking for blackberry phones, it shows all of the blackberries on all networks. This makes it easy to see where the cheapest place is to get the model of phone you want. A lot of the phones are free after rebate on Wirefly which beats the instore buying experience where you generally have to pay for the nicer phones.

One thing they dont do very well is compare plans across networks. Once you click to look at the plans, you then have to select the network. A better way to do it would be to allow the user to look at plans by how many anytime & other minutes there are. 

So, anyway, back to my blackberry pearl story. You can get one for free on wirefly.com with a t-mobile contract. You can also get two for free with a shared plan of $59.99 a month, but you have to pay 9.99 shipping. The other catch is you have $150 in mail in rebates for the two phones. In any case, this is much better than paying $199 per phone direct from t-mobile. 

Overall, I am impressed. I can safely say that I will use Wirefly.com over buying a phone from a store or from the online store of t-mobile or others. It's so much cheaper, you have to be an idiot to do otherwise. The thing I have yet to have an experience with is the delivery, exchange process etc... Who is responsible if the phone breaks? Check out Wirefly.com and decide for yourself!
