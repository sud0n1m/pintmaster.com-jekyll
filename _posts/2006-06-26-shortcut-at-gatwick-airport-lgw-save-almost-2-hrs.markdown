I flew Continental Airlines from London Gatwick yesterday and the line was a mile long. I didnt wait in it, but someone I talked to said they waited for approximately 2 hours to check in. I waited 15 minutes to drop off my bag and was then ready to go through security. How did I do it? Online check-in. I checked in and printed my boarding pass the night before and then went to the bag drop to get rid of my bag. Continental's check-in area is a little bit hidden and it is a maze. You have to go down a ramp to check in for economy. There is one line for the bag-drop, and it is right next to the first class check in. The secret way to get there is either an elevator or a set of stairs to the right of the long ramp that goes down. Hope this helps you save a couple of hours of your life.
