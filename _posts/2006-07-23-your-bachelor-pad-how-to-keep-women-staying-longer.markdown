So you're a geek & lets say when you go on a camping trip, or to a lan party, there are certain things that are must haves when you go! Well, this is a list of must haves to keep the women staying longer when you successfully get them to come over.
<span style="font-weight: bold" />

<strong>The Living Room</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Comfy sofa that is good for snuggling and watching a movie (blanket is good too!)</li>
	<li>DVDs that girls want to watch (go look at myspace profiles). They dont necessarily have to be ones you dont want to watch</li>
	<li>Nice artwork on the wall. You want to show you have taste!</li>
	<li>Decent T.V. and Stereo. Girls dont find it sexy to watch movies on your laptop.</li>
	<li>Interesting coffee table books - travel, architecture, art, something you are interested in</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Refreshments</span>

A woman isnt going to stay very long if she is parched or hungry. They, unlike guys cant live on beer and cereal alone. Have the following things available:
<ul>
	<li>Diet Coke, San Pellegrino (sparkling water), Fruit Juice</li>
	<li>Chocolate (good stuff), Mixed nuts & other snacks, Hersheys Syrup (for chocolate martinis and a whole lot more), Fresh fruit</li>
	<li>Champagne (have both cheap and good depending on the woman), Red Wine, White Wine, Good Vodka (Belvedere, Grey goose), Godiva Liqueur (for chocolate martinis)</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Bathroom</span>

Everyone has to go to the bathroom eventually. Make sure yours is clean! If you pass that test, make sure there it has the following things to keep her smelling and feeling clean:
<ul>
	<li>Nice hand soap is a must. You may not wash your hands after going to the bathroom, but have some soap so she can</li>
	<li>Hand Lotion (smaller nice ones from l'occitane en provence will go over really well)</li>
	<li>Nice towels (both hand and bath towels - one for you and one for her)</li>
	<li>Mints, gum (this way if she has bad breath, she can be discreet about fixing it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Bedroom</strong>

If you've played your cards right and gotten this far. Here is what I would recommend
<ul>
	<li>Stereo for playing "mood music". Get an iPod Hi-fi and have a playlist set up with your favorite sexual songs. Dont use your laptop, or play things through your xbox. Keep it simple so you can focus on her, and not the technology</li>
	<li>Candles - to set the mood and allow you to see if she prefers to turn off the lights</li>
	<li>Massage oil / bar - for a little fun</li>
	<li>Condoms - discretely within reaching distance from your bed (in case you get lucky)</li>
</ul>
This is just a simple list to get you started. Add some personal touches to each of these areas to let the woman know how unique and interesting you are. You want your place to be somewhere she is comfortable and where she feels like she gets insight into you.

Good Luck!
