<p>The site I&rsquo;ve been working on, <a href="http://prayabout.com">PrayAbout.com</a> just got <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/07/30/spiritual_support_in_a_virtual_community/">written up in the Boston Globe</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prayabout.com"><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/prayabout.png" alt="PrayAbout" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Internet start-up <a href="http://prayabout.com/">PrayAbout.com</a> marries the ultimate in user-generated content &mdash; people&rsquo;s deepest prayers &mdash; with the collective empathy of the crowd, in a variation on the social dynamics that have become common on secular sites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was tired of seeing a video of a grandmother falling down or someone recommending a news story &mdash; this is trying to add some real value to peoples&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; said Rodger Desai, who helped develop PrayAbout.</p>
