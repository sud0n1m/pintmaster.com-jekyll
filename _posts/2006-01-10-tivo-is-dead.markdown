If Gearlive's prediction that the new HD tivo will be approx. 800 - 1200 dollars upon its release, then the company is a goner. I pay $12 per month (with free upgrades when a new box comes out) from Time-Warner Cable for their Tivo knock-off. At the low end, $800 bucks, it would take 66 months to make the Tivo worth owning. By that time, I would already be on about 3 or 4 upgrades to my current $12 a month box.  I imagine that by that time, the knockoff will be at Tivo standards. No sell!
