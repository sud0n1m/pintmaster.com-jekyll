<p>I attended the Open Coffee Club meeting in London today and met some very interesting and inspiring people. If you&rsquo;re thinking about starting up a business and you&rsquo;re in the London area, it&rsquo;s well worth a trip. I wish I could go next week, but I&rsquo;ll be back in Boston. Expect to see me at the meet in Boston!</p>
