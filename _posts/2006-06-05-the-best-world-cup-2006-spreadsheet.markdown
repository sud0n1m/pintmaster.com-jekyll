I was sent this as a mass forward and this sheet is fantastic. I tried to search for it because my version had a bunch of bugs and got a junky, poorly done sheets back so I thought I would post the best damn world cup excel sheet up here. Probably the best thing about it is the TV schedule so it shows all the local times.

Features (from the website)
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">There are 4 sheets in the        workbook. The Match Schedule sheet lists every match in match day order        and is where you enter the scores. The Groups sheet is the list of group        tables. The Wallchart sheet is a chart display of match results for the        knockout stages. The TV schedule sheet lists each match in date/time order        displaying both the German kick off time and your local time.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Each country has their flag        displayed for the matches and the group tables.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Clicking on a country flag will        play the national anthem and display the lyrics if possible. Note that        this requires Internet Explorer to be your default web browser.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">You can select your favourite        team by clicking in cell to the right of the text 'My Favourite Team'. All        matches involving your favourite team will be highlighted in all 4 sheets.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">A map of Germany is displayed        in the Match Schedule sheet. When you select the row for the match the row will be        highlighted and the city where the match is being played will be coloured in the map.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Clicking on on a city in the        map will display a picture of the stadium for 2 seconds.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">The Match Schedule sheet will        automatically scroll up or down based on your currently selected cell so        that the map is in view.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">After the scores for a match        have been entered the group tables will be updated and sorted in        accordance with the official FIFA rules for the tournament. If a group is        tied after the first 6 criteria, a userform will appear asking you to rank        the teams for the result of drawing lots by the FIFA World Cup committee.        If you make a mistake click the Draw Lots button at the bottom of the        Groups sheet.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">After each group is complete        (i.e. the 6 matches for the group have been played) the round of 16 team        names will begin to appear in the match day list.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">If there is a tie after extra        time in the knockout stages (match day 49 onwards) a userform will appear        asking you to enter the results of the penalty shootout.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">The page setup has been set for        you to print each sheet on a single page. You can freely adjust these        settings as you please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
