The power has started to get a little spotty. The lights have flickered off and on about 3 times now. Veronique thought she heard the garage door motor turn on so I went downstairs and disconnected the garage door from the track. Im watching the movie Constantine right now w/ Keanu Reeves. It is basically "The Matrix" but with angels and demons and he is the guy that needs to save everyone. Unfortunately not as good as "The Matrix". I was hoping power would stay up at least until tomorrow morning. Now I am not so sure.
