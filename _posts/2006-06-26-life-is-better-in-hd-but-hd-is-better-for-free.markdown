I cancelled Time Warner Cable and returned my DVR. Im now using an antenna to get OTA broadcasts of HDTV and my computer to record it. I could not justify the $60 for TV (beyond the main networks) that I barely watch. I would encourage anyone else out there to do the same. I have an indoor antenna and the signal is not 100%. I will be changing this to an outdoor antenna when I can find a good installer since I dont have a ladder tall enough to get on my roof.
