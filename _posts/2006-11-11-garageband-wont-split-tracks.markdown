I have been using <a href="http://apple.com/garageband">Garageband</a> to edit some audio conversations. Unfortunately, I ran into a prohibitive bug that means I can no longer use garageband. I have researched online and have not seen a solution to this problem. Other users of Garageband running intel Macs have noted this issue and I think it may be specific to intel mac users. In any case, I'll have to find another way to edit my audio. Take a look at what happens when I try to trim the fat from a conversation. Here is the before image:

then I press apple-T to split the track and:

Errr, Apple, please fix this. That is not how the application is supposed to behave!

There are some others who have had the same issues on the apple support board: <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=3518263">1</a>, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=1864818">2</a>, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=2474229">3</a>
