This is my first time writing here, but for those that know me, there are some significant things going on that I can update you on. First and foremost, I graduate from college on Saturday 15th May 2004 from <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">RPI ( Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute )</a> from the <a href="http://lally.rpi.edu">Lally School of Management and Technology</a> with a bachelor in Management and a concentration in Management Information Systems. For those that dont know what that is, it is working with databases and stuff. Look for graduation pictures in <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim">My Pictures</a>.<br>
  <br>
  After graduation, I will be spending time with my wonderful girlfriend <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum3.html">Veronique</a> before going on a big trip to see some good friends of mine in Australia (Sascha), Spain (Duncan), Thailand (Bob). I will also be going to England to spend some time with <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum4.html">the family</a> and to Turkey to spend some time on a boat there. All in all, it should be a pretty busy and fun summer. 
    <p>Upon my return from the summer trip, I will be coming back to my <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum7.html">new apartment</a> in Houston, TX where I will be starting work as a Shipbroker. I will be working with chemical companies to find space on ships to transport their cargoes and vice-versa finding cargoes for ships that have space. This is definitely different than where I thought I would be after college. I was thinking more along the lines of doing database stuff. Having gotten the vibe of what it entails over the summer in NYC, I decided to do something that feels a little less comfortable. Nonetheless, I am extremely excited about starting my job and am looking forward to working hard and doing well.
