I am a big fan of paying for code. You may have seen my successful <a href="http://onmac.net">contest to get Windows XP installed on the Intel Mac</a>. Well, google is now running a <a href="http://desktop.google.com/contest.html">contest for their Google Desktop product</a> which will award money for the best gadgets - 5000 for first prize, 2000 for second and 1000 for third.
