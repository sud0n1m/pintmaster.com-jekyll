<blockquote>
HONOLULU (AP) -- Contaminated carrots served on several flights out of Honolulu are believed to have caused 45 cases of food poisoning for people in Florida, 21 other states, Japan, Australia and American Samoa.

The outbreak has sparked a lawsuit by an Orlando man against airline caterer Gate Gourmet. Its staff put the carrots in meals served for three days late last August. 

Ernie Lyon says in the lawsuit that he developed nausea, diarrhea, cramps, fever and tremors three days after a Northwest Airlines flight from Honolulu to Minneapolis. He tested positive for the Shigella bacteria. 

The Food and Drug Administration has sent a warning letter to Gate Gourmet. 

The letter cites violations found in a February inspection of Gate Gourmet's Honolulu facility. Problems included pink slime dripping onto a conveyor belt to a pot-washing machine, mold on refrigerator windows, live cockroaches and flies. 

The company provides meals for Northwest, Delta, United, Hawaiian and Aloha airlines.
