Upon a recommendation from <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/06/27/i-get-schooled-by-an-expert-in-site-design/">Vishen at Mind Valley</a>, I was relying on <a href="http://zookoda.com">Zookoda</a> for this site&rsquo;s email list. Rather than build and maintain the software myself, I relied on their skilled programmers and support staff to do it for me.Â   <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/05/should-you-rely-on-others/#more-99">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
