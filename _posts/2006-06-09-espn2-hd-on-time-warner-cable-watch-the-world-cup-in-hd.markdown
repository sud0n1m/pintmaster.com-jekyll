Most of the games are being played on ESPN2-HD. Why do I have time warner cable when they dont have ESPN2-HD? I have an HDTV, but I am unable to use it for 32 world cup games. This is bullshit. I just called up Time Warner Cable to yell at the person on the other end. I am even thinking about switching to dish, but I wont. We have ESPN2 and ESPN2 at work - it just doesnt seem worth it since I am thinking of getting rid of subscription tv COMPLETELY.
