It seems that a lot of people are uncomfortable investing in the stock market. They think it is too risky and they will lose their money... or they think that they simply dont have enough money to invest. They are wrong. I have made 20% gains on my Roth IRA account this year to date by making some educated guesses on investments. Others should be able to do the same and beat the S&P. I will fully disclose the stock purchases that I make and write articles about the various investments that I am looking at. Hopefully, I will even convince a few of you out there that you too can reap what you sow in the stock market if you invest with patience, guts and a little research.
