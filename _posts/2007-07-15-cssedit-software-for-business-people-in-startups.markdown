<p><strong>Use Case:  </strong>You&rsquo;ve outsourced the design of your startup site to a professional design firm (you&rsquo;re smart enough to know not to hire an in-house designer yet). The website has a small change that needs to be made. You can either pay your design firm $500 to make the change, or do it yourself.  <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/15/cssedit-software-for-business-people-in-startups/#more-133">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
