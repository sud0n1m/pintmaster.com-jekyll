Well, it is <a href="http://bf2004.net/">Black Friday</a>, the hottest shopping day of the year. I went with Kristian this morning to Best Buy at 6:00 am which is when the doors open. The line to get in was all the way around the block. The parking lot overflowed into the empty lot next door. We joined the end of the line with a bunch of people in front of us all coordinating their Black Friday shopping with other people on their cellphones. Once we got in, all of the $29.99 160GB Harddrives were gone. I ended up leaving with an APC Battery backup saved 40 bucks on the lowest online price (since we always lose power in H-town and the new U2 cd. Kristian bought a Canon DV Camera for 269.99. The price the day before at Best Buy was 349.99. The price elsewhere was $399.99. After Best Buy, we headed over to CompUSA. I wanted to get an Antec Sonata case for my computer. I had previously bought this for my grandma and the thing is so quiet that I decided to get rid of my green case that sounds like a jet engine and get something quiet. It will be so much better for watching movies. All in all, I guess we made out ok today. Black Friday is not the best deal of the year, it is more like a bunch of good deals all on the same day.
