Not that I am looking for em, but I found a great website to buy <a href="http://www.bluenile.com/">diamonds online</a>. The website is <a href="http://www.bluenile.com/">Blue Nile</a>. I also read an <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/fo/041111/ebabdf1504ac3a2244828d03a5643acf_1.html">article about it from Forbes</a> who have also <a href="http://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=2242">reviewed the website</a>. Seems like you can save a bunch of $$$ by not buying from <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/">Tiffany's</a> since they have similar stones at <a href="http://www.bluenile.com/">much lower prices</a>.
