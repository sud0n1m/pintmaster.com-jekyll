One of the people in my office sent me <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=wilson">this story from ESPN</a> about a young athlete named Genarlow Wilson who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Georgia for receiving oral sex from a 15 year old. Well, it's on video, she consented and he was 17. 

That is not okay. You could probably put about 10% of males in jail using that logic! Me included!
