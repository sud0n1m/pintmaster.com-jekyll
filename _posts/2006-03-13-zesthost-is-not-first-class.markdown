I signed up for <a href="http://zesthost.com/">zesthost hosting</a> for my project <a href="http://windowsxp.onmac.net">windows XP on an Intel Mac</a> and I have to say that I am really really disappointed with how poor the hosting is. As I write this, the site is currently down. Since I signed up it has been down at least 10 times that I noticed - and who knows how many more times. It is constantly slow to load when there is not significant traffic and the host hasnt done anything to make it better. They told me they would move it to a new server, but I can say that if this is their new server I am on now, that it sucks.

<strong>Update</strong> : After receiving a lot of traffic last night my 125gb per month account is suspended? I have been getting around 8000 hits a day prior to yesterday when it spiked to 30,000. That does not generate 125gb of traffic in half a month considering that there is nothing but images to download on the site. This is quite ridiculous.

<strong>Update: </strong>Some have pointed out that it is more likely due to the processor demands rather than the bandwidth.

<strong>Update: </strong><a href="http://winxponmac.com">winxponmac.com</a> is up on a different server - windowsxp.onmac.net, forum.onmac.net and windows.onmac.net are not. I have been trying since 9:30 pm CST last night to get in touch with Zesthost but have had no luck until now - 12:30 pm CST the next day. Im going to try and pay them more to put me on a better server to get the site back up - I know it looks bad and Im sorry for the downtime.

<a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> saved the day. We are now hosted on a 5-node cluster with true professionals at the helm. I have to say that my experience with rackspace has been top notch since we moved there 2 days ago. It sure beats mediocre virtual hosts.
