<a title="MacBook Pro Heat Repair Photoset" href="http://flickr.com/photos/32848675@N00/sets/72057594134489253/"><img align="right" alt="MacBook Pro Repair" id="image154" title="MacBook Pro Repair" src="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/146182077_f78caa803e_m.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>There have been quite a few posts around the net already on how to fix the heat issues on the first few revisions of the MacBook pro. I tried it, and it appears to work!

I followed the: <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/85.1.0.html"> iFixit guide</a> to disassemble my MacBook. The only thing I didnt have to do was remove the harddrive. I then cleaned with Arcticlean 1 and Arcticlean 2 and then applied my Arctic Silver 5 to just the die - like apple should have done. It was really time consuming and you have to be careful... but I think it might be worth it.

<strong>First 24 Hours</strong>

My MacBook Pro still gets damn hot. I've read that the Arctic Silver takes some time to cure. I am booted into windows right now where the MacBook pro gets the hottest. I ran a very repetetive macro in excel that turned the fans on pretty high speed. That made me realize that I've never really heard the fans before.
