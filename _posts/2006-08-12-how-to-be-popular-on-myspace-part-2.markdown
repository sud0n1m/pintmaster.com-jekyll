By now you've read my insanely useful article: <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/index.php/20060725/how-to-be-popular-on-myspace/">How to be popular on MySpace part 1</a>. Well, now we're gonna start talking to people to see what works and what doesnt when trying to meet people!

By now you've got an awesome profile and people are probably sending you messages! If not, dont worry! We'll get that started right now.

<a id="p205" rel="attachment" class="imagelink" title="Picture 5.png" href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/index.php/20060812/how-to-be-popular-on-myspace-part-2/picture-5png/"><img align="right" title="Picture 5.png" id="image205" alt="Picture 5.png" src="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Picture%205.thumbnail.png" /></a>The best way to find interesting people that you may be able to meet is to "browse" for people in your area. Put in your zipcode, and the type of people you are looking to meet. I would just put single women (or men if you are a woman or gay man) within 5 or 10 miles of my zip code that are aged 21 - 27 or something similar. Then, browse the profiles and pick out a few you like.

<strong>The Neg</strong>
Im going to introduce you to a pick up artist technique called "the neg". It wont work on everyone, but generally it works well on good looking people (im not sure how well it works on guys). The idea of a neg is that it is a backhanded compliment. A commonly used example is "Nice nails! Are they real?".

Take a look at the persons pictures, and pay them a backhanded compliment - or say something where they will feel like they have to qualify themselves to you. What most dumbasses do is they will see a picture they like and send the person a message saying "Damn girl, you're smoking!" or something similar to that. The person will probably not respond to that. What they will respond to is something along the lines of "Why dont you ever smile in any of your pictures? You're kinda cute like my little sister:)". Most good looking people on myspace will have some sort of "bitch shield" up to random strangers saying things to them. However, if you point out something that no one else has, they will feel compelled to qualify themselves to you and win you over.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Banter</span>
You can use a neg a few times in conversation to banter back and forth. If you do it too much, they take it as offensive and will stop talking to you. Alternatively, you may want to ask them a question that makes them think, or something that they will feel like they want to share their opinion about. Look at their profile for clues on this. I sometimes say that I am new to houston and I need to know the hot places to go for dancing or something like that. This does two things. It makes them curious about from where you came and also has them think about what cool places they would recommend so as not to disappoint you.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Moving from myspace to the real world</span>
This is probably the hardest step. It is definitely a lot easier if the other person asks you first. Basically, you should at some point start talking about what you like to do. I've tried a few things that seem to work. Challenge the person by saying things like "We could never hang out - we are too similar! We would argue all the time!". Question them about how fun they actually are. You want the other person to invite you to a location where they are going with friends. This is much better than trying to set up a "date" per se. Remember, if you are a guy inviting a woman, the chances of her coming are slim to none by herself. Suggest that she bring her friends to the place you guys will be. It helps if there is a special event going on there that night. If you are a guy and the girl invites you somewhere, the best thing to do is show up with some girls also. This gives you additional credibility as a guy who women find attractive.

Remember... dont take anything too personally. You will get rejected more than you will be invited out. The success rates at a bar / in person are much higher than online, but you can cover a lot of ground much faster online and it is easier to pick out people that you would want to spend time with.

Have fun!
