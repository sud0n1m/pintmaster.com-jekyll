<h3>Broadband in Bali</h3>
<p>Bali Internet service providers (ISPs).Here&rsquo;s an industry with reasonable competition but very high prices. The main problem is the lack of a fat pipe between Bali and the rest of the world. There&rsquo;s no undersea fiber direct to Europe and the US. From what I understand, a lot of the internet providers go by satellite to Singapore or Hong Kong and then from there to the rest of the world. My current traceroute shows a similar path. A server in the middle of the US would go California - Hong Kong at a fast speed and then off to Jakarta, Indonesia via Satellite sloooooowwly and then from there probably by cable to Bali.</p>
<h3>The Baseline</h3>
<p>So, you have a lot of users competing for a relatively limited transpacific connection which makes broadband internet pretty expensive. As a comparison, my 8 Mb / second comcast connection in Boston costs about $50 a month for unlimited internet. I could theoretically download 3.5 gigabytes an hour / 84 gigs a day / 2.5 Tb a month.</p>
