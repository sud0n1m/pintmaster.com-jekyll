Ok, so I thought I would give a rundown of my grievances. Im going to be working to fix these and will be posting the solutions I come up with so stay tuned!
<ol>
	<li>Overscan - This is a pretty common phenomenon with televisions. In simple terms, the signal extends past the borders of the screen. In XBMC (Xbox Media Center), there was a built in tool to bring the screen in. This is not built in to Windows Media Center, and I have not yet been able to get any tools I have tried to work</li>
	<li>TV Reception - The antenna I bought does not pick up all the channels and watching HDTV using the antenna can be a pain in the ass at times. Im going to remedy this by installing an antenna either in the attic or on the roof.</li>
	<li>Windows Media Center does not play all files. Mostly, I have experienced problems with files that have AC3 5.1 encoding. Windows Media center seems to choke on these, but media center classic works fine. This is an acceptable workaround for the time being.</li>
	<li>Noise - When switching out the powersupply, it also took away my ability to control the speed of the fans. I need to do some research to find out the best way to slow down the fans based on temperature. The box runs pretty loud right now.</li>
	<li>Subscribing to RSS feeds. Right now I am using uTorrent which does a fantastic job. Sometimes there are multiple releases of the same shows, so I need to fine tune my uTorrent subscriptions. It would also be nice to see a web interface to uTorrent.</li>
</ol>
The most annoying of these is the overscan, so that is the one I am going to try and tackle first. Wish me luck! I hope to have it solved by the end of the week.
