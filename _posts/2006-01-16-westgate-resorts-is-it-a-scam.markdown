I recently reported about <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/20051129/awards-verification-center/">Silverleaf Resorts</a> and was amazed at the response that I got to it. These guys are definitely scumbags. Googling for them brings up a epinions on the second link. What about Westgate Resorts? They are on the first floor of my building with an office on the second. When I leave work at around 6:30, they are getting started with their day. I can smell the fresh baking cookies as I leave for my car and all the lower middle income people streaming in for some free food, and dreams of sitting by the pool sipping a margarita. Is this a scam? Westgate Resorts is the third largest timeshare company in the U.S. Can a company grow to this size playing it fair. Do they use the same high-pressure sales tactics that timeshares are so well known for. Watch this space as I try and find the answers.
