Im not sure why, but Brits dont write reviews. I've recently purchased some components for my parents home theater system, for which I will be writing reviews when we get them! When I buy things in the US, I search for reviews about items before buying them. What I noticed in the UK is that there are very few reviews / it is very hard to find reviews on electronics. The items we purchased are as follows:

TILT & ROTATE ARM BRACKET 32" to 60" (BGL1) from Brackets UK
Pioneer S-V810A-W from digital direct
Panasonic TH-42PX60B-WAL from digital direct
Pioneer VSX-2016AV-S from digital direct
Belkin Silver Series Pureav 16Awg Hi-Performance Speaker Cable, 100' from Amazon
Belkin HDMI to HDMI Audio Video Cable 2m from Savastore

The only thing I was able to easily find information on was the TH-42PX60 which is probably the most purchased plasma HDTV around. The rest of them, Im shooting a little bit in the dark but did the best I could. I will share my experiences on these items when I receive them in order to help others in the future.

If brits wrote more reviews, the consumer would presumably be more educated and there wouldnt be such large discrepancies in pricing between different stores.
