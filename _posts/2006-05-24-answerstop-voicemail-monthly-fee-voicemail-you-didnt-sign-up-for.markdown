<div align="left">If you see the words "Answerstop Voicemail Monthly Fee" on your phone bill for $16.48, you may have a service you didnt sign up for.</div>
My colleague in my office started getting this on her phone bill and I have to sit across from her. I've heard her yelling her head off at these people trying to get this service removed.

The number for these people is +1-866-928-1093 and apparently, the people in charge are Mike and Christina.

Services they illegally put on your phone bill include:
<ul>
	<li>Answerstop Voicemail</li>
	<li>Privacy Plus Voice Mail</li>
	<li>Voice Express</li>
	<li>VoiceXpress</li>
	<li>Antivirus Email</li>
</ul>
