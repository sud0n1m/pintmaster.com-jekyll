I tried installing Fedora Core 5 on a Dell Poweredge 1850 with Perc 4e/si raid at work today. Unfortunately the driver (megaraid) seems to have a bug that causes the system to crash. Im not alone in the problem and it seems <a href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Fedora/2005-01/3072.html">others have had the same thing happen</a>.

Im going to give <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> a try to see if I can avoid switching back to Debian. Not that I dont like Debian, but it is just a big pain to get things set up.

Update: I got <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> installed and it works like a dream. I expected this since it is built on debian. It is much easier to manage and is better documented. The community is a lot less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">1337</a> than the Debian community. It makes it a lot easier to get help when linux is not your full time job / life.
