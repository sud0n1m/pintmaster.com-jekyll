I ordered my MacBook pro on Friday as a replacement for both my IBM desktop at work and for my Powerbook G4 1.25 Ghz as my backup / presentation computer. Im really excited for it to arrive, and I am taking a little bit of a gamble that someone will figure out how to make it run windows pretty quickly so that I can switch between the two operating systems. Should be pretty great. The main thing I am worried about now is when I will get natively compiled updates to previous software programs - like adobe photoshop etc... Anyway, I like being on the cutting edge.
