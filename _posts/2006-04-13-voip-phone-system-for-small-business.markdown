I am trying to find a VOIP phone system to replace our current PBX. This is really confusing. There are so many options and not a good rundown of what the top 10 are. I havent even seen a concise breakdown of what the differences are between cisco and the other big boys and all these small voip companies. Im going to try and set this straight. Hope I can do it. I would love to see any resources that do a good job of this.
