<p><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/beacon_town1.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="beacon_town1.jpeg" align="left" />I&rsquo;ve spent several months researching and looking at properties in Boston. I can&rsquo;t find a single property in the Back Bay, Beacon Hill or South End where the rental income covers the costs. Im looking at multiple unit buildings (4 - 6 units) with a cap at around $2 million. <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/13/property-in-boston-a-bad-investment/#more-130">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
