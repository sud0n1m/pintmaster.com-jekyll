I was checking out <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-admin/fundable.org">fundable.org</a> as an alternative to using paypal on <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-admin/winxponmac.com">winxponmac.com</a>. This site was recommended by several people during the day today. I wont use <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/wp-admin/fundable.org">Fundable.org</a> for several reasons.
<ul>
	<li>They take 10% if your goal is met. (average so far with paypal is 4.4%)</li>
	<li>You have to set goals and limited time frames - it isnt possible to have an open ended fundraiser and I dont want to shoot too low for the prize in this contest. The time frames were 25 days or 15 days. I expect the contest may last longer</li>
	<li>Pain of switching - I thought about adding fundable as an alternative, but that 10% commission didnt sound very good to me.</li>
</ul>
Hope this explains why I decided to stick with paypal even though it is administrative hell! I spent 2 hours updating the website tonight with people who have donated. There are over 120 donors and counting!
