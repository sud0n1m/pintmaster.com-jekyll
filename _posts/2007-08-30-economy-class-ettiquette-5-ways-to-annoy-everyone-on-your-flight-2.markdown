On my flight, it occurred to me that too few people know how to behave on an airplane. Here are the top tips on how to annoy the people on the plane around you.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the &ldquo;seat pocket in front of you&rdquo;&hellip; <em>constantly</em></strong>. Send morse code to the person in front via their lower back. Try this one &ldquo;.. &mdash; / .- -. / .. -.. .. &mdash; -&rdquo; (<a href="http://morsecode.scphillips.com/jtranslator.html">morse code converter</a>)</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>Play Risk.</strong>  Expand your territory outward from seat 22B<strong></strong><strong>. </strong>The armrest is merely a guide to where your space ends and your neighbor&rsquo;s begins. Don&rsquo;t stop growing your  turf until you feel the cold hard steel of 22C&rsquo;s seatbelt. Remember, it&rsquo;s your obligation to use a laptop when in the middle seat.<strong></strong><strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Use the built in sound on your laptop to watch a movie</strong>. That plane is loud, so turn it up. Wait till you see the jealousy on everyone&rsquo;s face when you&rsquo;re watching Vin Diesel&rsquo;s latest flick.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Get up using all available seats in front of you. </strong>Be oblivious to the fact that when you do it jolts the people in front. When they turn to see what&rsquo;s going on, scowl at them for being nosy. Don&rsquo;t forget to do the same when sitting down!</li>
<li><strong>Always drink coffee and/or alcohol before and during your trip (only for window seats)</strong>.Going to the bathroom is never more fun when you make 2 other people move for you. For maximum pleasure, ask them to get up when the cart has just passed. This way you need to make the flight attendants move too.</li>
</ol>
