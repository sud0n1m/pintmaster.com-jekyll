How ridiculous does that statement look! If you were wondering why your headers stopped printing when you print your outlook email, that is the answer. By installing Internet Explorer 7, you are foregoing your right to consistently print header information in Outlook. Several people in my office were reporting that some of their emails were printing without the header info. Upon doing a search in google for the phrase "email only prints text of the message", I found the <a href="http://help.lockergnome.com/office/Outlook-2003-prints-body-header-information-ftopict889192.html">following discussion @ lockergnome</a>

<blockquote>I believe this problem started when IE7 was installed as I haven't seen it on machines that still have IE6.</blockquote>

and then another frustrated user:

<blockquote>ts definitely IE7 there are so many people (not just in these forums but also in others across the net) having the same problem - me too.

Microsoft are exceptionally quiet on this front. the only known solution i've seen is to uninstall IE7 & go back to IE6. i hae tried other fixes ie re-editing HTML back into plain & then putting back to HTML - this works sometimes - but sometimes not & is very time consuming.</blockquote>

So, what did I do? I removed IE 7 from all of my users computers and faster than you can say "microsoft needs help", they were all printing Outlook emails with headers again.

Im in the process of reviewing Office 2007 and Windows Vista, and it wont be much different than this review.
